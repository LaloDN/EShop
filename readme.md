## Update 12/21/2022

At this point, I've make the first version of the relational database, while making the model, I realized it's a better idea to make another application to manage the stores inventory, so I'm strating another project before starting this one: I'm making a manager application to add the stock on a graphic way instead using the database, also this will help making bigger my portfolio!

[You can follow the manager application status on my repo](https://github.com/LaloDN/Electro_Shop_Manager)
